# Sky130A_Inverter
An Inverter built using the Skywater 130A technology

So far, I have only added the gds files for the inverter and ring oscillator, the layers file, and the drc file. I plan to add all necessary files to complete the initial schematic, layout, DRC, LVS, RC extraction, and post layout verification.
